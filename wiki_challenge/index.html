                    The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle originally invented in 1974<sup><a
                            href="#ref">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref">[3]</a></sup>
                    by
                    Hungarian sculptor
                    and
                    professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube,<sup><a
                            href="#ref">[4]</a></sup> the puzzle was
                    licensed
                    by
                    Rubik to be sold by Pentangle Puzzles in the UK in 1978,<sup><a href="#ref">[5]</a></sup> and then
                    by Ideal Toy Corp in
                    1980<sup><a href="#ref">[6]</a></sup>
                    via
                    businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer.<sup><a href="#ref">[7]</a></sup> The
                    cube was released
                    internationally
                    in
                    1980 and became one of the most recognized icons in popular culture. It won the 1980 German Game of
                    the
                    Year special award for Best Puzzle. As of January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold
                    worldwide,<sup><a href="#ref">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref">[9]</a></sup>[needs update] making it
                    the world's bestselling puzzle game<sup><a href="#ref">[10]</a></sup><sup><a
                            href="#ref">[11]</a></sup> and bestselling
                    toy.<sup><a href="#ref">[12]</a></sup> The Rubik's Cube was inducted into the US National Toy Hall
                    of Fame in 2014.<sup><a href="#ref">[13]</a></sup>

                    On the original classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, each of
                    one of
                    six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. Some later versions of the cube have
                    been updated to use coloured plastic panels instead, which prevents peeling and fading.<sup><a
                            href="#ref">[14]</a></sup> Since
                    1988,
                    the arrangement of colours has been standardised with white opposite yellow, blue opposite green,
                    and
                    orange opposite red, and the red, white, and blue arranged clockwise in that order.<sup><a
                            href="#ref">[15]</a></sup> On early
                    cubes,
                    the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.<sup><a href="#ref">[16]</a></sup>

                    An internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours. For
                    the
                    puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to have only one colour. Similar puzzles have now
                    been
                    produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.

                    Although the Rubik's Cube reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still
                    widely
                    known and used. Many speedcubers continue to practise it and similar puzzles, and compete for the
                    fastest times in various categories. Since 2003, the World Cube Association, the international
                    governing
                    body of the Rubik's Cube, has organised competitions worldwide and recognises world records.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    In the mid-1970s, Ernő Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied
                    Arts
                    and Crafts in Budapest.[18] Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching
                    tool to
                    help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem of
                    moving
                    the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart. He did not realise that he had
                    created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore it.[19]
                    Rubik
                    applied for a patent in Hungary for his "Magic Cube" (Hungarian: Bűvös kocka) on 30 January 1975,[4]
                    and
                    HU170062 was granted later that year.

                    The first test batches of the Magic Cube were produced in late 1977 and released in Budapest toy
                    shops.
                    Magic Cube was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle being easily
                    pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ernő Rubik's permission, businessman
                    Tibor
                    Laczi took a Cube to Germany's Nuremberg Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise
                    it.[20]
                    It was noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and they signed a deal with Ideal Toys in
                    September
                    1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide.[20] Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to
                    trademark;
                    that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in
                    1980. The puzzle made its international debut at the toy fairs of London, Paris, Nuremberg, and New
                    York
                    in January and February 1980.[21]

                    After its international debut, the progress of the Cube towards the toy shop shelves of the West was
                    briefly halted so that it could be manufactured to Western safety and packaging specifications. A
                    lighter Cube was produced, and Ideal decided to rename it. "The Gordian Knot" and "Inca Gold" were
                    considered, but the company finally decided on "Rubik's Cube", and the first batch was exported from
                    Hungary in May 1980.[22]

                <p>
                    A standard Rubik's Cube measures 5.6 centimetres (2+1⁄4 in) on each side.[49] The puzzle consists of
                    26
                    unique miniature cubes, also known as "cubies" or "cubelets". Each of these includes a concealed
                    inward
                    extension that interlocks with the other cubes while permitting them to move to different locations.
                    However, the centre cube of each of the six faces is merely a single square façade; all six are
                    affixed
                    to the core mechanism. These provide structure for the other pieces to fit into and rotate around.
                    Hence, there are 21 pieces: a single core piece consisting of three intersecting axes holding the
                    six
                    centre squares in place but letting them rotate, and 20 smaller plastic pieces that fit into it to
                    form
                    the assembled puzzle.[50]

                    Each of the six centre pieces pivots on a screw (fastener) held by the centre piece, a "3D cross". A
                    spring between each screw head and its corresponding piece tensions the piece inward, so that
                    collectively, the whole assembly remains compact but can still be easily manipulated. The screw can
                    be
                    tightened or loosened to change the "feel" of the Cube. Newer official Rubik's brand cubes have
                    rivets
                    instead of screws and cannot be adjusted. However, Old Cubes made by the Rubik's Brand Ltd. and from
                    dollar stores do not have screws or springs, all they have is a plastic clip to keep the centre
                    piece in
                    place and freely rotate.

                    The Cube can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by rotating the top layer by 45° and
                    then
                    prying one of its edge cubes away from the other two layers. Consequently, it is a simple process to
                    "solve" a Cube by taking it apart and reassembling it in a solved state.

                    There are six central pieces that show one coloured face, twelve edge pieces that show two coloured
                    faces, and eight corner pieces that show three coloured faces. Each piece shows a unique colour
                    combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, if red and orange are on opposite
                    sides
                    of the solved Cube, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides). The location of these
                    cubes
                    relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube by increments of 90
                    degrees, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of
                    the
                    puzzle cannot be altered; it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares. However,
                    Cubes
                    with alternative colour arrangements also exist; for example, with the yellow face opposite the
                    green,
                    the blue face opposite the white, and red and orange remaining opposite each other.

                    Douglas Hofstadter, in the July 1982 issue of Scientific American, pointed out that Cubes could be
                    coloured in such a way as to emphasise the corners or edges, rather than the faces as the standard
                    colouring does; but neither of these alternative colourings has ever become popular.[44]

                <p>
                    The puzzle was originally advertised as having "over 3,000,000,000 (three billion) combinations but
                    only
                    one solution".[51] Depending on how combinations are counted, the actual number is significantly
                    higher.

                    <h3>Permutations</h3>
                    <p>
                        The original (3×3×3) Rubik's Cube has eight corners and twelve edges. There are 8! (40,320) ways
                        to
                        arrange the corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of
                        eight)
                        can be oriented independently; the orientation of the eighth (final) corner depends on the
                        preceding
                        seven, giving 37 (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges,
                        restricted from 12! because edges must be in an even permutation exactly when the corners are.
                        (When
                        arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined
                        arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation.) Eleven edges can be
                        flipped
                        independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 211 (2,048)
                        possibilities. To put this into perspective, if one had one standard-sized Rubik's Cube for each
                        permutation, one could cover the Earth's surface 275 times, or stack them in a tower 261
                        light-years high.

                        The preceding figure is limited to permutations that can be reached solely by turning the sides
                        of the cube. If one considers permutations reached through disassembly of the cube, the number
                        becomes twelve times larger.This is because there is no sequence of moves that will swap a
                        single pair of pieces or rotate a single corner or edge cube. Thus, there are 12 possible sets
                        of reachable configurations, sometimes called "universes" or "orbits", into which the cube can
                        be placed by dismantling and reassembling it.

                        The preceding numbers assume the centre faces are in a fixed position. If one considers turning
                        the whole cube to be a different permutation, then each of the preceding numbers should be
                        multiplied by 24. A chosen colour can be on one of six sides, and then one of the adjacent
                        colours can be in one of four positions; this determines the positions of all remaining colours.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="centre-face">
                    <h3>Centre Faces</h3>
                    <p>
                        The original Rubik's Cube had no orientation markings on the centre faces (although some carried
                        the "Rubik's Cube" mark on the centre square of the white face), and therefore solving it does
                        not require any attention to orienting those faces correctly. However, with marker pens, one
                        could, for example, mark the central squares of an unscrambled Cube with four coloured marks on
                        each edge, each corresponding to the colour of the adjacent face; a cube marked in this way is
                        referred to as a "supercube". Some Cubes have also been produced commercially with markings on
                        all of the squares, such as the Lo Shu magic square or playing card suits. Cubes have also been
                        produced where the nine stickers on a face are used to make a single larger picture, and centre
                        orientation matters on these as well. Thus one can nominally solve a Cube yet have the markings
                        on the centres rotated; it then becomes an additional test to solve the centres as well.

                        Marking Rubik's Cube's centres increases its difficulty, because this expands the set of
                        distinguishable possible configurations. There are 46/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres since
                        an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of quarter turns of centres as well.
                        In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares,
                        there will always be an even number of centre squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus
                        orientations of centres increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from
                        43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3×1019) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022).[54]

                        When turning a cube over is considered to be a change in permutation then we must also count
                        arrangements of the centre faces. Nominally there are 6! ways to arrange the six centre faces of
                        the cube, but only 24 of these are achievable without disassembly of the cube. When the
                        orientations of centres are also counted, as above, this increases the total number of possible
                        Cube permutations from 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022) to
                        2,125,922,464,947,725,402,112,000 (2.1×1024).

                    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Rubik's cubers' parlance, a memorised sequence of moves that has a desired effect on the cube
                        is called an "algorithm". This terminology is derived from the mathematical use of algorithm,
                        meaning a list of well-defined instructions for performing a task from a given initial state,
                        through well-defined successive states, to a desired end-state. Each method of solving the Cube
                        employs its own set of algorithms, together with descriptions of what effect the algorithm has,
                        and when it can be used to bring the cube closer to being solved.

                        Many algorithms are designed to transform only a small part of the cube without interfering with
                        other parts that have already been solved so that they can be applied repeatedly to different
                        parts of the cube until the whole is solved. For example, there are well-known algorithms for
                        cycling three corners without changing the rest of the puzzle or flipping the orientation of a
                        pair of edges while leaving the others intact.

                        Some algorithms do have a certain desired effect on the cube (for example, swapping two corners)
                        but may also have the side-effect of changing other parts of the cube (such as permuting some
                        edges). Such algorithms are often simpler than the ones without side effects and are employed
                        early on in the solution when most of the puzzle has not yet been solved and the side effects
                        are not important. Towards the end of the solution, the more specific (and usually more
                        complicated) algorithms are used instead.

                    <h3>Relevance and application of mathematical group theory</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rubik's Cube lends itself to the application of mathematical group theory, which has been
                        helpful for deducing certain algorithms – in particular, those which have a commutator
                        structure, namely XYX−1Y−1 (where X and Y are specific moves or move-sequences and X−1 and Y−1
                        are their respective inverses), or a conjugate structure, namely XYX−1, often referred to by
                        speedcubers colloquially as a "setup move".[55] In addition, the fact that there are
                        well-defined subgroups within the Rubik's Cube group enables the puzzle to be learned and
                        mastered by moving up through various self-contained "levels of difficulty". For example, one
                        such "level" could involve solving cubes that have been scrambled using only 180-degree turns.
                        These subgroups are the principle underlying the computer cubing methods by Thistlethwaite and
                        Kociemba, which solve the cube by further reducing it to another subgroup.
